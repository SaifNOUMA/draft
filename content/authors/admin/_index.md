I am a first year Ph.D student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/) (USF).
I received my B.Eng. degree in CSE from [École Polytechnique de Tunisie](http://www.ept.rnu.tn/) in September 2020.
Currently, I am a member of [Applied Cryptography Research](https://cse.usf.edu/~attilaayavuz/#group) group at USF. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Attila A. Yavuz](https://cse.usf.edu/~attilaayavuz).

My research spans the domains of applied cryptography and machine learning, with special interests on conceiving, analyzing, and implementing cryptographic tools and protocols to enhance the security of computer networks and systems.
